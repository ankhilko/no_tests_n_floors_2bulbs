There is a building. This building has 100 floors. You are given two lightbulbs.
The fact about those lightbulbs is that they start breaking when thrown down from some specific floor.
Let's say for example that thrown from the 31st floor lightbulb doesn't break and from 32nd it breaks.
Your task is to find an algorithm that will find the floor number from which lighbulb starts breaking with as little throws as possible.
